## The README for BIOL5153
###### BIOL5153 is a repository for class assignments and projects, file contents are as follows:

*[Jupyter_hw](https://github.com/kjjudy/BIOL5153/tree/master/Jupyter_hw)* contains records of work-throughs of chapters in Dr. Martin Jones's [Python for Biologists](https://pythonforbiologists.com/) in Jupyter notebooks.  Naming convention is jnhw + \(assignment number\)_\(chapter number\).

*[Jupyter_lec](https://github.com/kjjudy/BIOL5153/tree/master/Jupyter_lec)* contains records of in-class exercises in Jupyter notebooks or as Python executables.  Naming convention for the Jupyter notebook(s) is jnlec +\(jupyter assignment number\)_(corresponding book chapter\).

*[CV.md](https://github.com/kjjudy/BIOL5153/blob/master/CV.md)* is my CV.

*[parseGFF](https://github.com/kjjudy/BIOL5153/tree/master/parseGFF)* is a project folder for building a Python script to parse GFF data files into .fasta format.  The script is [ParseGFF.py](https://github.com/kjjudy/BIOL5153/blob/master/parseGFF/ParseGFF.py) and associated Jupyter notebook practice files are also present. Currently the program input is hard-coded to my file system at lines 6 and 11.
